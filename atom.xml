    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to make a place where I can share my long-form thoughts. This is long overdue. I used to have a Wordpress blog, but WP comes with a lot of overhead and cruft I don&#8217;t really need. It seems like every other week, there&#8217;s some new security exploit that requires a full upgrade to patch.</p>

<p>Octopress seems to bring it back to the basics, which I really appreciate. And by skipping the database, it&#8217;s ultra-speedy.</p>
