    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love Refresh D.C.&mdash; I&#8217;ve been going since I first moved to the D.C. area in late 2007. (Back then I lived in Reston, so it was a serious schlepp to get to the city.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the topics border on &#8220;listen to my thoughts about design&#8221;&mdash;which can be really fun, don&#8217;t get me wrong&mdash;but given the choice I&#8217;d much prefer something more solidly instructional.</p>

<p>Thankfully <a href="https://twitter.com/trevor_davis">Trevor&#8217;s</a> Compass/SASS presentation dove into the nitty gritty. The majority of his presentation was lines of CSS, before &amp; after the SASS preprocessing. I went into the lecture thinking I wasn&#8217;t going to learn much, but was pleasantly surprised. A couple of things were brand new to me, and others I knew about, but didn&#8217;t know why I&#8217;d want to use them.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to make a place where I can share my long-form thoughts. This is long overdue. I used to have a Wordpress blog, but WP comes with a lot of overhead and cruft I don&#8217;t really need. It seems like every other week, there&#8217;s some new security exploit that requires a full upgrade to patch.</p>

<p>Octopress seems to bring it back to the basics, which I really appreciate. And by skipping the database, it&#8217;s ultra-speedy.</p>
