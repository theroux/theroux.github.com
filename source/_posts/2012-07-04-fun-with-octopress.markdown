Just wanted to make a place where I can share my long-form thoughts. This is long overdue. I used to have a Wordpress blog, but WP comes with a lot of overhead and cruft I don't really need. It seems like every other week, there's some new security exploit that requires a full upgrade to patch.

Octopress seems to bring it back to the basics, which I really appreciate. And by skipping the database, it's ultra-speedy.
